  # This configuration triggers the workflow:

  # The configuration allows the workflow to be triggers manually through the GitHub Actions user interface.
  # When choosing the workflow in the left margin under the Actions tab in GitHub's Web UI,
  # there will be a "Run" drop-down listbox in the Web UI's far right, which can be used to manually trigger the workflow.

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# Jobs are defined as entries under "jobs"
jobs:

  # This workflow contains a single job called "integrate" (the name will be shown in the workflow's output when it's run).
  # We can call this anything we like.
  integrate:
    
    # Runs on the latest version of Ubuntu
    # GitHub will create a virtual machine or container, where we can choose what image to use under "runs-on"
    # In this case, the virtual machine/container is based on the latest version of Ubuntu (a Linux distro)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Under "env", we can define environment variables that will be available in the virtual machine/container created above.
    env:
      NAME: metube-user
      CONTAINER_NAME: metube-user
    
    # "Steps" represents a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      
      # The "uses" instruction is used to execute a pre-defined action
      # In this case, the "actions/checkout@v4" is used
      # This action basically does a "git clone" in the virtual machine/container created above to copy this repository to it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # This pre-defined action installs Dotnet in the virtual machine/container created above
      # A "uses" action can be configured using a "with" section.
      # In this case, the version of dotnet to install is configured to version 9.0.101.
      # This means we can now run "dotnet" commands in the virtual machine/container created above
      - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
        with:
          dotnet-version: 9.0.101

      # Every step can be given a name (which will be shown in the workflow's output when it runs)
      # In this case we are calling the step "Set up Docker" (we can call it anything we like)
      # Then, as part of the same step, we are using a pre-defined action that installs Docker into the virtual machine/container
      # This means we can now run "docker" commands in the virtual machine/container created above
      # Note: Currently we aren't using any Docker commands inside the virtual machine/container in this workflow 
      - name: Set up Docker
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

      # This step is given the name "Test"
      # Then the "run" instruction is used to run a command inside the virtual machine/container created above
      # In this case we are running the command "dotnet test MeTube-DevOps.UserService"
      # - The "dotnet test" command will find the Solution file "MeTube-DevOps.UserService/MeTube-DevOps.UserService.sln"
      # - The Solution file contains a project reference to "MeTube-DevOps.UserService/MeTube-DevOps.UserServiceTests/MeTube-DevOps.UserServiceTests.csproj"
      # - The project file contains information about the project being of type "xUnit"
      # - The "dotnet test" command finds all tests in MeTube-DevOps.UserServiceTests and executes them

        run: dotnet test MeTube-DevOps.UserService
