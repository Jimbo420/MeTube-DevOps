# MeTube-DevOps

## Description
This is our group project for our DevOps course.

It's supposed to be a simple YouTube-inspired web application that demonstrates core video streaming concepts—uploading, searching, and playing videos—while focusing on clean design and user-friendly interactions.
The microservices that we managed to create are *Gateway*, *Client* and *UserService*.
But we only managed to finish the sign-up and log-in features during our short sprints.

### Sprint 1
#### Planning
- **Sprint Backlog**:
  - *User Story 1*: As a user I should be able to sign up so that I have a user account.
  - *User Story 2*: As a developer, I want to setup Docker for the microservices.
  - *User Story 3*: As a developer I want the project to be setup with sub-projects for all microservices.

#### Review
- **Completed**:
  - *User Story 1*: Implementation of registration logic and functionality (Sign-Up).
  - *User Story 3*: Setup of microservice skeleton (not yet implemented).
- **Not Completed**:
  - *User Story 2*: Docker setup not implemented (Not enough time).
- **Issues**:
  - Integration with the database took longer than expected.
  - We had environment setup issues.
  - Very short sprint period, only 3 days.


#### Retrospective
- **What went well**:
  - Clear communication in daily stand-ups.
  - Smooth process for defining user stories.
  - Good distribution of tasks.
  - Strong attendance and engagement
